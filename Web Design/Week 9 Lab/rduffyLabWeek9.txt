You can ignore the Game code (Rock Paper Scissors). I was going to tackle that, but I realised that the best way to meet the requirements of the lab for it (based on the way I'd already built the game) didn't actually involve using any Loops.
So the Song and Grades elements are what include relevant loops for grading.
